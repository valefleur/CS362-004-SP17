Title:  Playing Adventurer Rarely Discards Correctly  

Class: Serious Bug
e.g. "Feature Request", "System Error", "Serious Bug"

Date: 28th May 2017      
Reported By: edwardse  
Email: edwardse@school.edu

Priority: Major

Product: Dominion.c                  Version: sabinc-assignment-4
Platform: Flip2                      Version: 3.10.0-327.36.3.el7.x86_64
      

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
When the PlayAdventurer() function is called, the current player should draw 
cards until having drawn two treasure cards, and should then discard any other
drawn card.

Instead, the current player will only discard until the number of non-treasure
cards drawn is less than 100.  Rarely, especially in a realistic situation, will
the current player have drawn nearly 100 cards, let alone 100 non-treasure cards.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
Initialize the game.  Set the current player's deckCount to something less than 100.
Ensure at least two cards are treasure cards.

Call PlayAdventurer(), passing it the current game state. 


Expected Results
----------------
The current player will draw cards until having drawn two treasures.  All cards 
drawn, except the two treasures, will be discarded.


Actual Results
--------------
If the current player draws less than 100 cards, no cards will be discarded.


Workarounds
-----------
Initialize the game.  Set the current player's deckCount to 102 or more cards.  
Ensure none of the cards in the deck in the first 100 positions are treasure cards.

Title:  Playing Smithy Causes the Current Player to Draw an Extra Card  

Class: Serious Bug
e.g. "Feature Request", "System Error", "Serious Bug"

Date: 28th May 2017      
Reported By: edwardse  
Email: edwardse@school.edu

Priority: Major

Product: Dominion.c                  Version: sabinc-assignment-4
Platform: Flip2                      Version: 3.10.0-327.36.3.el7.x86_64

Is it reproducible: Yes, consistently

Description
===========
Playing Smithy causes the current player to draw four cards instead of the expected
three.  In fact, the number of cards drawn is MAX_PLAYERS, which can change, causing
the current player to draw a varying number of cards between different games and/or 
versions.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
Initialize the game.  Either insert, or find a Smithy card in the current player's 
hand.

Call PlaySmitty(), passing it the game state and the hand position of the smithy
card.


Expected Results
----------------
The current player will draw three cards.  Always.


Actual Results
--------------
The current player will draw MAX_PLAYERS cards, which is currently set to four.


Workarounds
-----------
Set MAX_PLAYERS to three before compiling and running dominion.c.
