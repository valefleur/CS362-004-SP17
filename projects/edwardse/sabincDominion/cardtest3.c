    /*PLEASE NOTE: playFeast() has an intentional bug in it from Assignment 2.  This bug
    causes the function to enter a condition that prevents it from exiting a loop.
    The bug did not cause the infinite loop itself, but did create the situation where
    a normally acceptable play cannot leave the loop.
    
    The question about turning in unit tests that exercise inifite loops has been asked
    in Piazza (@62) and, as of writting this, has no answer.  For the time being, I have
    removed the intentional bug so running the unit tests avoids hitting the infinite loop.
    
    In a production envionrment, I would discuss the infinite loop issue with the developer,
    and suggest refactoring the function to be more robust (aka, avoid the possibility
    of infinite loops.*/
